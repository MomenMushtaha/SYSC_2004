PROJECT TITLE:ClockDisplay2 
VERSION or DATE: Feb 07, 2020
AUTHORS: Mo'men Mushtaha
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The main objective of this assignment is to learn how to use the object-oriented
mechanism of composition to define classes in Java using BleueJ. To this end we will be
reusing the clock-display project that has two classes: NumberDisplay, and ClockDisplay
from Chapter 3.
1. Describe the changes that would be required to the ClockDisplay class in order to
be able to display hours, minutes, and seconds. How many NumberDisplay
objects would a ClockDisplay object need to use?
2. Write the code for the timeTick method in ClockDisplay that displays hours,
minutes, and seconds, or even implement the whole class if you wish.
3. Rewrite the new version of ClockDisplay class by incorporating the changes you
suggested in 1. and 2.
4. Instantiate an object of ClockDisplay and exercises the constructors and methods
(especially the timeTick method) of the class ClockDisplay using BlueJ.
