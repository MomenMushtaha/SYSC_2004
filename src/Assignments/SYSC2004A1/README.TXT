PROJECT TITLE:BankAccount 
VERSION or DATE: Jan 26, 2020
AUTHORS: Mo'men Mushtaha
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
Write a class called BankAccount that has two instance variables (fields) the first stores
the account number, and the second stores the current balance of the account. This class
contains two mutator methods to debit and credit the account. Define a third accessor
method that returns the current balance. Define a fourth method to print out (to display)
account information. Define two constructors; the first one is a no-argument constructor
(known as the default constructor) and the second one passes two values to set an
account number and an initial balance. Instantiate two bank accounts and exercises the
methods of the class using BlueJ.
